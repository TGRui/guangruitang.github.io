I am a PhD student at University of Arizona working on machine learning and optimization.

My research is mainly about distributionally robust optimization, regularization in machine learning 
and hyperparameter optimization.

Before that, I obtained bachelor's degree and master's degree in Biomdeical Engineering
at Beihang University, where I worked on medical signal processing and medical image processing.
